# art-gallery


TO-DO:


Read the papers I mentioned:
-read and understand the hardness reduction. Can I do this from set cover? How would I do this from set cover? Are there variants that limit the number of sets any element can be contained in? Or number of elements a set can have?

Read their submodular proofs


Formulate a tractable variant of dynamic art gallery, or weights where I need to use an LP

Can I try and do this all tonight?
